## Background

Hey, I'm James 👋

I have worked in technology for 12 years. My educational background is in Computer Science; I hold a First Class degree 
from the University of Kent, Rutherford College. I've typically stuck to startups as I value the high-impact work and rapid progression. In that time, I've been a part of two acquisitions and massive growth.

I position myself and my skill set as a business-focused engineer. I remain technical and still code, albeit less frequently now. My roles recently have transitioned more into technical leadership and management; I've built and grown tech teams at well-funded startups and ensured we reached fundraising and business milestones. In those nine years, I'm proud to say I've helped raise tens of millions for the businesses I've been a part of.

I have a wealth of experience across the stack and still consider myself very much a full-stack engineer at heart. I have a polyglot mindset and typically will use the best tool for the job. As a result, I've used many languages and frameworks throughout my career. I love to look at the challenge a company faces, not simply which language it has decided to use.
