## Research
### The Open Group: Archimate OWL Project

I worked on an international research team within the Open Group to build an XML derivative that allowed
standardised exchange of enterprise architecture diagrams between different software tools.

### Open Source 

Driven by a deep-seated belief in collaboration and transparency, I'm profoundly passionate about contributing to and advocating for open source. üîìüåç‚ù§Ô∏è

## Mentorship

I am really passionate about mentorship, I've been part of a few schemes in my time. Originally I mentored on [Revive](https://revivejobs.tech), which is sadly no longer active. I have often given advice to engineers early in their journey, looking to start their own business or join an early stage startup.

I now mentor on [Zero Gravity](https://www.zerogravity.co.uk). I offer career advice to aspiring software engineers and university advice to aspiring Computer Scientists.

Everyone should have a mentor, I've been fortunate to have a few great ones over the years. 

## Misc
### Google Hashcode

Every year I compete with a group of university friends in Google Hashcode, no winning attempts quite yet!
