# Reading List

I find myself recommending the same books all the time.

As a result I've compiled a list of books that I think are the most impactful for surving startups. 

Naturally, these are focussed on technology startups. But there is a good mixture of general business and career books in here too.

I hope you find them useful. 

## Books

[Build](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59696349) - Tony Fadell

This book is excellent. Written by the person behind the iPod. It reads as a set of short guides on all different aspects of building a high perfomring startup. 

[The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10127019) - Eric Ries 

Mandatory reading if you work in a startup. This is the playbook on how to innovate and iterate quickly. Well discussed examples and lessons learned the hard way. 

[Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes) - Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton

I would have thought a book on negotiation would have been boring. Not this one. Getting to yes is a fantastic resource to improve your negotiation skills. This is required for all aspects of life, one of my most gifted books. 

[Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25159062-narconomics?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11) - Thomas Wainwright

This is an excellent general economics book. This book explores how drug cartels have been so successful. How they operate as successful enterprises in their own right. It also discusses how legalising narcotics would likely lead to the downfall of the big global cartels. A great read with a unique take.

[How Big Things Get Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61327449-how-big-things-get-done) - Bent Flyvbjerg, Dan Gardner

A data-driven masterclass on project management. Based on research of over 16,000 projects, this book reveals why most big projects fail and how to succeed. The core principle of "plan slow, act fast" is counterintuitive but backed by compelling evidence. Essential reading for anyone running complex projects or trying to understand why things go over budget and schedule.

[Semi-Organic Growth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25652733-semi-organic-growth) - George T. Geis

An insightful look at Google's M&A strategy through 150+ acquisitions. This book introduces a framework for growth that sits between organic development and traditional acquisitions. Well-researched and practical, it's excellent for understanding how strategic acquisitions can accelerate product development. This was my go-to book in 2025 as I worked on several acquisitions at Carta.
