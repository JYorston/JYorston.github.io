# Reading List

I find myself recommending the same books all the time.

As a result I've compiled a list of books that I think are the most impactful for surving startups. 

Naturally, these are focussed on technology startups. But there is a good mixture of general business and career books in here too.

I hope you find them useful. 

## Books

[Build](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59696349) - Tony Fadell

This book is excellent. Written by the person behind the iPod. It reads as a set of short guides on all different aspects of building a high perfomring startup. 

[The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10127019) - Eric Ries 

Mandatory reading if you work in a startup. This is the playbook on how to innovate and iterate quickly. Well discussed examples and lessons learned the hard way. 

[Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes) - Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton

I would have thought a book on negotiation would have been boring. Not this one. Getting to yes is a fantastic resource to improve your negotiation skills. This is required for all aspects of life, one of my most gifted books.
